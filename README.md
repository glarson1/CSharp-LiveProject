# CSharp-LiveProject
## Introduction
The last two weeks of my time spent at The Tech Academy, I worked on an MVC web application in C# for a theatre in Portland. In this project I worked in a team of fellow students for the rental based section of the site. The team communicated through Discord, and project management was carried out using Azure DevOps. Throughout the project I worked on both the front end and the back end to complete my stories and continue progress of the application. The things I learned on this project I believe will be put to use on many future project whether or not those projects use the same stack or not.
## Overview
My first story of the project was to create a method that can be used to limit the number of words displayed using ellipses. For example, "Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum" would turn into "Lorem Ipsum Lorem...". This way the user can still type all that they want but it wouldn't be displayed in a way that would take over the entire page. The method that I came up with was this:
